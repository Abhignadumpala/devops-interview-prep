# Day 24 — Kubernetes Probes (Startup, Liveness, Readiness) and Falco

[← Kubernetes notes](../README.md)

> **In short:** A container can be "running" but still broken (stuck, frozen, not ready). **Probes** let Kubernetes check the app by itself. **Liveness** = is it alive? If not, **restart** it. **Readiness** = is it ready for users? If not, **stop sending traffic** to it. **Falco** watches the cluster for **security threats** and sends alerts.

## 1. What is a probe?

**Definition:** A **probe** is a **health check** that the **kubelet** (on the worker node) runs on a container **again and again, every few seconds** (interval you set).

**Why?** Kubernetes already restarts a container when its process **crashes**. But if the app is **stuck** (process running, app not responding), Kubernetes can't see the problem without a probe.

| Without probes | With probes |
|---|---|
| App frozen but process alive → K8s thinks it's fine | Liveness sees no response → restarts container |
| App still starting → users get errors | Readiness says "not ready" → no traffic yet |

| Probe | Question it asks | If it fails |
|---|---|---|
| **Liveness** | Is the app **alive**? | **Restart** the container |
| **Readiness** | Is the app **ready** to take traffic? | **Remove pod from Service** (no traffic), no restart |

---

## 2. Liveness probe

**Definition:** A **liveness probe** checks **if the application is alive (healthy)** every interval of time we set. **If it gets no response, Kubernetes restarts the container.**

**How it works, step by step:**

1. App is running in the container.
2. Every `periodSeconds` (e.g. 10s), the kubelet sends the liveness check (e.g. `GET /health`).
3. **Response OK** → "yes, healthy" → **keep running**.
4. **No response / error** (for `failureThreshold` times in a row, e.g. 3) → "not healthy" → **restart the container**.

```

        ▼

        │
        ▼
     Healthy?
     │      │
    YES     NO
     │      │

```

![Liveness probe](images/liveness-probe.png)

**Key points:**

| ✅ | |
|---|---|
| Checks application health | Every interval we set |
| Detects stuck applications | Process alive but app frozen (deadlock, hang) |
| Automatically restarts container | No human needed |
| Self-healing feature of Kubernetes | App fixes itself |

> ⭐ **Liveness probe = self-healing for your application.**

**Common parameters:**

| Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `initialDelaySeconds` | Wait before the first check (give the app time to boot) |
| `periodSeconds` | How often to check |
| `timeoutSeconds` | No answer within this time = failed check |
| `failureThreshold` | Number of failures in a row before the container is **restarted** |

**Example YAML:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: liveness-http
  labels:
    app: web
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

    livenessProbe:             # alive? if not → RESTART the container
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 15  # wait 15s before 1st check
      periodSeconds: 10        # check every 10s
      timeoutSeconds: 2        # no answer in 2s = fail
      failureThreshold: 3      # 3 fails → restart
```

**How to see it:**

```bash
kubectl get pods                  # RESTARTS count goes up when liveness fails
kubectl describe pod liveness-http
#   Warning  Unhealthy  Liveness probe failed: ...
#   Normal   Killing    Container nginx failed liveness probe, will be restarted
```

| `kubectl get pods` shows | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `READY 1/1`, `Running`, RESTARTS `0` | Alive → keeps running |
| `Running`, RESTARTS keeps going up | Liveness failing → container restarted again and again |
| `CrashLoopBackOff` | Restarted too many times → Kubernetes waits longer before each restart |

> Liveness failing gives **restarts / CrashLoopBackOff**. Readiness failing gives **`0/1 Running`** with no restart.

> **Interview one-liner:** A liveness probe checks if the application is alive; if not, Kubernetes restarts the container.

---

## 3. Readiness probe

**Definition:** A **readiness probe** checks **whether a pod is ready to receive user traffic**.
- If the check **fails**, Kubernetes **removes the pod from the Service endpoint list**.
- The pod **keeps running** (no restart) but **does not receive traffic until it becomes ready**.

![Readiness probe](images/readiness-probe.png)

**Why do we need it after liveness?**
Liveness only says the app is **alive**. Alive is not the same as **ready**. An app can be running but still loading data, cache or a DB connection. If users are sent to it now, they get errors. Readiness makes sure **traffic goes only to pods that are ready**.

| | Alive? (liveness) | Ready? (readiness) | Gets traffic? |
|---|---|---|---|
| App starting, loading data | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ No |
| App fully started | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Yes |
| DB connection lost for a while | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ No (comes back when ready) |
| App stuck / frozen | ❌ → restart | ❌ | ❌ No |

**Service endpoint list** = the list of pod IPs a Service sends traffic to. Only **Ready** pods are in it.

**How it works, step by step:**

1. Pod starts → **not ready yet** → not in the endpoint list → **no traffic**.
2. After `initialDelaySeconds`, the kubelet runs the readiness check every `periodSeconds`.
3. **Check passes** → pod marked **Ready** → added to the endpoint list → **gets traffic**.
4. **Check fails** `failureThreshold` times → pod marked **Not Ready** → **removed** from the endpoint list → no traffic. The pod **keeps running**.
5. Check passes again → added back → traffic comes back. **No restart at any point.**

```
 User ──► Service ──┬──► Pod 1 (Ready ✅)      gets traffic
                    ├──► Pod 2 (Ready ✅)      gets traffic
                    └──✖ Pod 3 (Not Ready ❌)  running, but NO traffic, NOT restarted
```

**Important points:**

| | |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Ensures traffic goes **only to healthy and ready pods** |
| 🚫 | Prevents users from reaching apps that are **still starting up** |
| ⏱️ | Used when apps need **time to load data, cache or dependencies** (DB, other services) |

**Probe types: the SAME 3 methods as liveness (HTTP endpoint, TCP port, EXEC command). Only the probe name changes** (`livenessProbe:` → `readinessProbe:`):

| Type | Checks | Liveness | Readiness |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HTTP** | A web URL (endpoint) returns 200–399 | `livenessProbe:` + `httpGet:` | `readinessProbe:` + `httpGet:` |
| **TCP** | A port is open | `livenessProbe:` + `tcpSocket:` | `readinessProbe:` + `tcpSocket:` |
| **Exec** | A command inside the container exits 0 | `livenessProbe:` + `exec:` | `readinessProbe:` + `exec:` |

```yaml
readinessProbe:          # only this name is different
  httpGet:               # or tcpSocket: / exec: — same as liveness
    path: /
    port: 80
```

> Same check, **different action on failure**: liveness → **restart**, readiness → **no traffic**.

**Common parameters:**

| Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `initialDelaySeconds` | Wait before the first check |
| `periodSeconds` | How often to check |
| `failureThreshold` | Number of failures before marking the pod **Not Ready** |

**Example YAML:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: readiness-http
  labels:
    app: web
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

    readinessProbe:           # ready? if not → NO TRAFFIC (no restart)
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 5  # wait 5s before 1st check
      periodSeconds: 5        # check every 5s
      failureThreshold: 3     # 3 fails → Not Ready
```

**How to see it:**

```bash
kubectl get pods                  # READY 0/1 = not ready (no traffic), 1/1 = ready
kubectl describe pod readiness-http
#   Warning  Unhealthy  Readiness probe failed: ...
kubectl get endpoints <service>   # only Ready pod IPs are listed
```

| `kubectl get pods` shows | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `READY 1/1`, `Running` | Ready → gets traffic |
| `READY 0/1`, `Running` | Running but **not ready** → no traffic, RESTARTS stays the same |

> Readiness failing gives **`0/1 Running`**, **not** CrashLoopBackOff, because there is no restart.

> **Interview one-liner:** A readiness probe checks whether a pod is ready to receive user traffic. If it fails, Kubernetes removes the pod from the Service endpoint list; the pod keeps running but gets no traffic until it becomes ready.

---

## 4. Startup probe

**Definition:** A **startup probe** is the **very first probe**. It checks **whether the application has finished starting**.

![Startup probe](images/startup-probe.png)

**Why?** Some apps (big Java apps, apps loading lots of data) take minutes to start. Without a startup probe, the **liveness probe** may check too early, fail, and **restart the container while it is still booting** → it never finishes starting → restart loop.

**Key points:**

| | |
|---|---|
| ⏱️ | Used for **slow-starting applications** that need extra startup time |
| 🛡️ | Prevents Kubernetes from **restarting a container while it is still booting** |
| ▶️ | Runs **only during the startup phase** |
| ✅ | Once it **succeeds**, it **stops running permanently** |
| 🔁 | After success, **liveness and readiness probes take over** |
| ❌ | If it **keeps failing**, Kubernetes **restarts the container** |

**In real time (where it's used):**

| | |
|---|---|
| 🏢 | Commonly used for **large Java, Spring Boot or database-based applications** with long startup times (1–5 min) |
| 🔁 | Helps **avoid unnecessary restarts** and **application CrashLoops** |
| 💡 | **Why it matters:** prevents premature (too early) restarts, saves resources, and ensures smooth application startup |

**Example problem without startup probe:** Spring Boot app needs **2 min** to start. Liveness checks after 15s → fails 3 times → restart → starts again from 0 → fails again → **CrashLoopBackOff forever**. With a startup probe allowing 5 min, the app boots fully, then liveness takes over.

**How it works, step by step:**

1. **Application starts** (booting).
2. **Startup probe** checks if the app has started (liveness and readiness are **paused** for now).
3. **Success** → "startup complete" → startup probe **stops** forever.
   **Failure** (keeps failing `failureThreshold` times) → container is **restarted** → back to step 1.
4. **Other probes take over:** liveness (alive?) and readiness (ready for traffic?) manage the app from now on.

```
 App starts ──► Startup probe ──► Success ──► stops ──► Liveness + Readiness take over
      ▲               │
      │               ▼
      └──── restart ◄─ Keeps failing
```

**Same 3 methods (HTTP / TCP / EXEC). Only the name changes:** `startupProbe:`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: startup-demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx

    startupProbe:              # 1st: has the app finished starting?
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      periodSeconds: 10        # check every 10s
      failureThreshold: 30     # allow 30 x 10s = 300s (5 min) to start

    livenessProbe:             # starts only AFTER startup probe succeeds
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      periodSeconds: 10

    readinessProbe:            # starts only AFTER startup probe succeeds
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      periodSeconds: 5
```

**Max startup time = `failureThreshold` × `periodSeconds`** → here 30 × 10s = **5 minutes**. If the app isn't up in 5 min → restart.

### Slow app: startup probe or long `initialDelaySeconds`?

**Answer:** use a **startup probe**. Don't give liveness a long delay.

**Example:** a Java app takes **1 to 4 min** to start (different each time).

| Option | Problem |
|---|---|
| Liveness `initialDelaySeconds: 300` | It's a **guess**. App up in 1 min → liveness still waits 5 min (a hang in that time is missed). App takes longer than the guess → still restarted. |
| Liveness `failureThreshold: 30` | Startup works, but this **stays forever**. Later a hang takes **5 min** to detect instead of ~30s. |
| ✅ **Startup probe** | Allows up to 5 min, but **stops as soon as the app is up**. Then liveness runs with normal fast settings. |

```
 Long delay on liveness:   [ wait 5 min always ][ slow checks forever ]   ❌
 Startup probe:            [ startup: up to 5 min, ends early ][ fast liveness checks ]   ✅
```

**What about readiness?** It does **not** need a long delay. A failed readiness check **doesn't restart** the container. The pod just shows `0/1 Running` (no traffic) until it's ready. The restart loop comes **only from liveness**, and the startup probe fixes it.

> ⭐ **Startup probe = long time allowed only at the start. Liveness = fast checks after that.**

> **Interview one-liner:** A startup probe is the first probe; it checks whether a slow-starting app has finished starting. Until it succeeds, liveness and readiness are paused, so Kubernetes doesn't restart the app while it boots. After it succeeds it stops, and liveness and readiness take over.

---

## 5. Liveness vs Readiness vs Startup

| | 🚀 Startup | ❤️ Liveness | 🚦 Readiness |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Simple word** | **Boot check** | **Self-healing** | **Traffic control** |
| **Question** | Has the app **finished starting**? | Is the app **alive**? | Is the app **ready** for user traffic? |
| **Order** | **1st** | After startup succeeds | After startup succeeds |
| **Runs when** | Only during startup, then **stops forever** | Whole life of the container | Whole life of the container |
| **On failure** | **Restarts** container | **Restarts** container | **Removes pod from Service endpoints** (no traffic) |
| **Restart?** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No, pod keeps running |
| **Pod status when failing** | Restarts → CrashLoopBackOff if it never starts | Restarts → CrashLoopBackOff if always failing | `0/1 Running` |
| **Problem it solves** | Slow app killed while still booting | App stuck / frozen (process alive, app not responding) | Users sent to a pod that is still loading / busy |
| **Real-time use** | Large **Java, Spring Boot, DB** apps with long startup | Every app (web, API) to auto-recover from hangs | Apps that load data, cache, connect to DB before serving |
| **Methods** | HTTP / TCP / EXEC | HTTP / TCP / EXEC | HTTP / TCP / EXEC |
| **YAML key** | `startupProbe:` | `livenessProbe:` | `readinessProbe:` |

```
Container starts
     │
     ▼
🚀 Startup probe ── keeps failing ──► restart
     │ success (stops)
     ▼
❤️ Liveness  (alive?  no → restart)        ─┐  both run together
🚦 Readiness (ready?  no → no traffic)      ─┘  for the whole life
```

> **Interview one-liner:** Startup checks if the app has finished booting (runs once, first); liveness checks if it's alive and restarts it if not; readiness checks if it's ready for traffic and removes it from the Service if not, without restarting.

> Use **both** together: readiness keeps users away from a pod that isn't ready; liveness restarts it if it's truly stuck.

> **Order:** startup probe runs **first** → when it passes, liveness and readiness start. See [section 4](#4-startup-probe).

## 6. How a probe checks the app (3 ways)

> ⭐ **One-liner:** There are **three ways to check if your app is alive: HTTP, TCP, EXEC.**
> **HTTP = endpoint | TCP = port | EXEC = command**

![Probe types: HTTP, TCP, EXEC](images/liveness-probe-types.png)

| # | Type | Checks | Healthy if | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **HTTP** (`httpGet`) | A **web endpoint** like `/health` | Response code **200–399** | Web apps, APIs |
| 2 | **TCP** (`tcpSocket`) | Whether a **port** is accepting connections | Port **opens** | Databases (MySQL 3306), Redis 6379 |
| 3 | **EXEC** (`exec`) | Runs a **command inside the container** | Command **exit code 0** | Apps without HTTP/port, custom checks |

### 1. HTTP probe = endpoint

The kubelet calls a URL of the app, like a browser: `GET http://<pod-ip>:8080/health`.
- Answer `200 OK` → alive ✅
- Error (500), no answer, timeout → failed ❌ → restart

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health      # the endpoint
    port: 8080
  periodSeconds: 10
```

### 2. TCP probe = port

The kubelet only tries to **connect to the port**. It doesn't send a request or read a reply.
- Port accepts the connection → alive ✅
- Connection refused → failed ❌ → restart

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  tcpSocket:
    port: 3306         # the port (MySQL)
  periodSeconds: 10
```

### 3. EXEC probe = command

The kubelet **runs a command inside the container** and checks its result (exit code).
- Exit code `0` → alive ✅
- Any other exit code → failed ❌ → restart

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  exec:
    command: ["cat", "/tmp/healthy"]   # the command
  periodSeconds: 10
```

**Which one to choose?**

| My app is... | Use |
|---|---|
| A website / API with a `/health` URL | **HTTP** |
| A DB or service that only listens on a port | **TCP** |
| Something that needs a custom check (script, file) | **EXEC** |

> The same 3 types work for **readiness** and **startup** probes too; only the action on failure is different.

---

## 7. Probe timing settings

| Setting | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `initialDelaySeconds` | Wait this long after container starts before 1st check | 0 |
| `periodSeconds` | **Interval**: check every N seconds | 10 |
| `timeoutSeconds` | Wait this long for a response | 1 |
| `failureThreshold` | Fail this many times in a row → action (restart / not ready) | 3 |
| `successThreshold` | Pass this many times → healthy again | 1 |

Example: `periodSeconds: 10` + `failureThreshold: 3` → app must fail for **~30 seconds** before restart.

---

## 8. Example YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-probes
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.27
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80

          livenessProbe:              # alive? if not → RESTART
            httpGet:
              path: /
              port: 80
            initialDelaySeconds: 10   # wait 10s after start
            periodSeconds: 10         # check every 10s
            failureThreshold: 3       # 3 fails → restart

          readinessProbe:             # ready? if not → NO TRAFFIC
            httpGet:
              path: /
              port: 80
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 5
```

**Liveness with `exec` (classic demo):**

```yaml
          livenessProbe:
            exec:
              command: ["cat", "/tmp/healthy"]   # file exists → healthy
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 5
```

Delete the file inside the container (`kubectl exec <pod> -- rm /tmp/healthy`) → probe fails → container restarts → `RESTARTS` count goes up.

---

## 9. Lab: liveness probe with httpGet (nginx)

**Goal:** check if the nginx app is alive using a **liveness probe** with the **HTTP (`httpGet`)** method.

![liveness-http.yaml](images/liveness-http-yaml.png)

### The code: `liveness-http.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: liveness-http
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx

    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80

      initialDelaySeconds: 15
      periodSeconds: 10
      timeoutSeconds: 2
      failureThreshold: 3
```

### Line by line

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `kind: Pod`, `name: liveness-http` | Create one pod named `liveness-http` |
| `name: nginx`, `image: nginx` | One container running the nginx web server |
| `livenessProbe:` | Check if the container is **alive**; if not → restart it |
| `httpGet:` | Use the **HTTP** method (call a web endpoint) |
| `path: /` | The **endpoint** to call. `/` = nginx home page |
| `port: 80` | **nginx listens on port 80**, so we check port 80 |
| `initialDelaySeconds: 15` | Wait **15 s** after the container starts before the 1st check (give nginx time to start) |
| `periodSeconds: 10` | Then check **every 10 s** |
| `timeoutSeconds: 2` | Wait max **2 s** for an answer; slower = failed |
| `failureThreshold: 3` | **3 failures in a row** → restart the container |

### What the probe actually does

Every 10 s, the **kubelet** (on the worker node) sends this request to the container:

```
GET http://<pod-ip>:80/
```

| nginx answers | Result |
|---|---|
| **200 OK** (path `/` exists, home page returned) | ✅ Healthy → keep running |
| **404 Not Found** (path doesn't exist), **500** error, or no answer in 2 s | ❌ Failed. 3 times in a row → **restart container** |

> **Path can be anything the app really serves:** `/`, `/dev`, `/health`, `/login`... The rule: the path must return **200–399**. Default nginx serves only `/`, so `path: /health` would get **404** → nginx would be restarted again and again even though it works fine.

> **Port must match the app:** nginx works on **80**. If you put `port: 8080`, nothing listens there → probe fails → restart loop.

### Timeline

```
0s    container starts
15s   1st check  GET /  → 200 ✅
25s   2nd check  GET /  → 200 ✅
35s   ...every 10s, keeps running

If nginx breaks:
 fail 1 ❌ → fail 2 ❌ → fail 3 ❌  (~30 s)  → kubelet RESTARTS the container
```

### failureThreshold → restart → CrashLoopBackOff

**Not on the 1st restart.** CrashLoopBackOff comes when the probe **keeps failing after every restart**.

| Situation | What happens | `kubectl get pods` STATUS |
|---|---|---|
| Fails 3 times (`failureThreshold`) **once**, then OK after restart | Container restarted 1 time → healthy | `Running`, RESTARTS 1 |
| Fails **every time**, even after restarts (wrong path, wrong port, app always broken) | Restart → fail → restart → fail... K8s waits **longer each time** (10s, 20s, 40s ... max 5 min) | **`CrashLoopBackOff`**, RESTARTS keeps going up |

```
fail x3 → restart #1 → fail x3 → restart #2 (wait 10s) → fail x3 → restart #3 (wait 20s) ...
                                                         └─► STATUS: CrashLoopBackOff
```

**CrashLoopBackOff** = "the container keeps failing, so Kubernetes is **backing off** (waiting longer) before the next restart."

**Example:** `path: /health` on default nginx → always 404 → CrashLoopBackOff.

**How to fix:**

```bash
kubectl describe pod liveness-http      # Events: "Liveness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 404"
kubectl logs liveness-http --previous   # logs of the container BEFORE the last restart
```

Then fix the probe (correct `path` / `port`, bigger `initialDelaySeconds` if the app is slow) and re-apply.

### Steps (run where kubectl works: Killercoda control plane / EKS bastion)

**Step 1 — create the file and the pod**

```bash
vi liveness-http.yaml          # paste the YAML above
kubectl apply -f liveness-http.yaml
```

**Step 2 — check it's healthy**

```bash
kubectl get pods               # STATUS Running, RESTARTS 0
kubectl describe pod liveness-http
#   Liveness: http-get http://:80/ delay=15s timeout=2s period=10s #success=1 #failure=3
```

**Step 3 — break it (test self-healing)**

Delete nginx's home page, so `/` stops returning 200 (nginx returns **403**):

```bash
kubectl exec liveness-http -- rm /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

**Step 4 — watch Kubernetes restart it**

```bash
kubectl get pods -w            # after ~30 s RESTARTS goes 0 → 1
kubectl describe pod liveness-http
#   Warning  Unhealthy  Liveness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 403
#   Normal   Killing    Container nginx failed liveness probe, will be restarted
```

The restarted container starts fresh from the image, so `index.html` is back → `/` returns 200 → healthy again. **That's self-healing.**

**Step 5 — clean up**

```bash
kubectl delete -f liveness-http.yaml
```

> **Interview one-liner:** I used an `httpGet` liveness probe on nginx: path `/` on port 80, first check after 15 s, then every 10 s with a 2 s timeout. After 3 failures in a row the kubelet restarts the container.

## 10. Lab: troubleshoot CrashLoopBackOff (wrong path, port, command)

**Goal:** in class we **broke the liveness probe on purpose** 3 ways (HTTP, TCP, EXEC) to see **CrashLoopBackOff** and learn how a DevOps engineer finds the cause.

### ⭐ First step as a DevOps engineer: `kubectl describe pod`

```bash
kubectl get pods                    # STATUS: CrashLoopBackOff, RESTARTS going up
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>     # go to the Events section at the bottom
```

The **Events** section tells you **exactly why** the probe failed:

| Event | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Warning  Unhealthy  Liveness probe failed: ...` | **The reason** (wrong path / port / command) ⬅️ read this line |
| `Normal  Killing  Container ... failed liveness probe, will be restarted` | Kubelet restarted the container |
| `Warning  BackOff  Back-off restarting failed container` | It keeps failing → **CrashLoopBackOff** |

### Test 1: HTTP probe, wrong path

Same `liveness-http` pod as [section 9](#9-lab-liveness-probe-with-httpget-nginx), but with a path nginx doesn't have:

```yaml
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /health     # ❌ wrong: default nginx has no /health page
        port: 80
```

`kubectl describe pod` shows:

```
Warning  Unhealthy  Liveness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 404
```

**Fix:** use a path the app really serves (`path: /`).

### Test 2: TCP probe, wrong port

Correct TCP probe (nginx listens on port 80):

![TCP liveness probe YAML](images/liveness-tcp-yaml.png)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: liveness-http-1
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx

    livenessProbe:
      tcpSocket:
        port: 80               # ✅ nginx port
      initialDelaySeconds: 10  # wait 10s before 1st check
      periodSeconds: 5         # check every 5s
      timeoutSeconds: 2
      failureThreshold: 3      # 3 fails (~15s) → restart
```

Then we created `liveness-http-2` with **`port: 81`** ❌ (nothing listens on 81). `kubectl describe pod`:

![kubectl describe pod: wrong port](images/describe-wrong-port.png)

```
Warning  Unhealthy  Liveness probe failed: dial tcp 192.168.1.74:81: connect: connection refused
Normal   Killing    Container nginx failed liveness probe, will be restarted
Warning  BackOff    Back-off restarting failed container nginx in pod liveness-http-2
```

`connection refused` on port **81** → wrong port. **Fix:** `port: 80`.

### Test 3: EXEC probe, wrong command

Correct EXEC probe: the container creates `/tmp/healthy`, the probe reads it with `cat`.

![EXEC liveness probe YAML](images/liveness-exec-yaml.png)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: liveness-exec-2
spec:
  containers:
    - name: busybox
      image: busybox
      command:                  # what the container runs
        - sh
        - -c
        - |
          echo "hello all" >> /tmp/healthy   # create the file
          sleep 3600                         # keep container alive 1 hour
      livenessProbe:
        exec:
          command:              # probe runs: cat /tmp/healthy
            - cat
            - /tmp/healthy      # ✅ file exists → exit 0 → healthy
        initialDelaySeconds: 5
        periodSeconds: 5
```

Then we changed the probe to read a file that doesn't exist: **`/tmp/health`** ❌

![EXEC probe with wrong file](images/liveness-exec-wrong-command.png)

`cat /tmp/health` → file not found → exit code 1 → probe fails. `kubectl describe pod`:

```
Warning  Unhealthy  Liveness probe failed: cat: can't open '/tmp/health': No such file or directory
```

**Fix:** correct the command (`/tmp/healthy`).

### Summary: CrashLoopBackOff from a liveness probe

| Probe | What we broke | `describe pod` error | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HTTP** | Wrong **path** (`/health`) | `HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 404` | Path the app serves (`/`) |
| **TCP** | Wrong **port** (81) | `dial tcp <ip>:81: connect: connection refused` | App's real port (80) |
| **EXEC** | Wrong **command** (`cat /tmp/health`) | `cat: can't open '/tmp/health': No such file or directory` | Correct command / file |
| Any | App too slow to start | Fails in the first seconds only | Increase `initialDelaySeconds` |

### Single pod: which probe is failing? (read `kubectl get pods`)

| READY | STATUS | RESTARTS | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `1/1` | `Running` | 0 | ✅ All good, gets traffic |
| `0/1` | `Running` → **`CrashLoopBackOff`** | **Going up** | ❌ **Liveness** or **Startup** failing (restarts) |
| `0/1` | `Running` | **Stays the same** | ❌ **Readiness** failing (no restart, no traffic) |

```
NAME     READY   STATUS             RESTARTS
pod-a    1/1     Running            0          ✅ all good
pod-b    0/1     CrashLoopBackOff   4          ❌ liveness or startup
pod-c    0/1     Running            0          ❌ readiness → no traffic
```

**Always confirm with `kubectl describe pod`** (Events show the exact probe):

| Event message | Probe |
|---|---|
| `Liveness probe failed: ...` + `failed liveness probe, will be restarted` | ❤️ Liveness |
| `Startup probe failed: ...` + `failed startup probe, will be restarted` | 🚀 Startup |
| `Readiness probe failed: ...` (no "will be restarted") | 🚦 Readiness |

> ⚠️ `0/1 Running` with RESTARTS 0 can also be **normal for a few seconds** right after start (startup probe still checking, or `initialDelaySeconds` not over). It's a readiness problem only if it **stays** `0/1`.

> With **one pod** and readiness failing, the pod shows no error, but **users get errors** because the Service has no ready pod: `kubectl get endpoints <svc>` is empty.

### Troubleshooting steps (in order)

1. `kubectl get pods` → see `CrashLoopBackOff` and RESTARTS count.
2. `kubectl describe pod <pod>` → read the **Events**: `Liveness probe failed: ...` tells you path, port or command.
3. `kubectl logs <pod> --previous` → app logs from **before** the last restart (did the app itself crash?).
4. Fix the YAML (path / port / command / delay).
5. Pod probe settings can't be edited in place → `kubectl delete pod <pod>` then `kubectl apply -f <file>.yaml`.
6. `kubectl get pods -w` → `Running`, RESTARTS stops going up ✅

> **Interview one-liner:** When a pod is in CrashLoopBackOff, I first run `kubectl describe pod` and read the Events. A liveness probe failure shows the exact reason: 404 for a wrong path, connection refused for a wrong port, or a command error for a wrong exec command. Then I check `kubectl logs --previous`, fix the YAML and re-apply.

### Other reasons for CrashLoopBackOff (not probes)

**Definition:** **CrashLoopBackOff** = the container **starts → crashes/exits → K8s restarts it → crashes again**, so K8s waits longer each time (10s, 20s, 40s ... 5 min). Probes are only **one** reason. Any reason the container **keeps stopping** gives the same status.

| # | Reason | Example | How you find it | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Missing environment variable** | App needs `DB_HOST`, it isn't set → app exits on start | `logs --previous`: `DB_HOST is not set` / `KeyError` | Add `env:` in the YAML (or ConfigMap/Secret) |
| 2 | **Wrong env value / config** | Wrong DB password, wrong URL in ConfigMap | `logs --previous`: `authentication failed`, `invalid config` | Correct the ConfigMap / Secret value |
| 3 | **Dependency not reachable** | DB / Redis / other service down or wrong host name | `logs --previous`: `connection refused`, `unknown host` | Start the dependency, fix Service name/port, add init container to wait |
| 4 | **App code error** | Bug, exception, missing library at startup | `logs --previous`: stack trace, `Exception` | Fix code, build new image |
| 5 | **Out of memory (OOMKilled)** | App uses more than `resources.limits.memory` | `describe pod`: `Reason: OOMKilled`, `Exit Code: 137` | Increase memory limit or fix memory leak |
| 6 | **Wrong command / args** | Typo in `command:` or the program doesn't exist in the image | `describe pod`: `Exit Code: 127` / `executable file not found` | Correct `command:` / `args:` |
| 7 | **Container finishes and exits** | `busybox` with no long-running command, script that just ends | `describe pod`: `Reason: Completed`, `Exit Code: 0` | Run a long-running process (`sleep 3600`, server), or use a **Job** for one-time tasks |
| 8 | **Permission denied** | Runs as non-root but writes to `/var/...`, file not executable | `logs --previous`: `permission denied`; Exit Code 126 | Fix file permissions, `securityContext`, writable volume |
| 9 | **Missing file / wrong volume mount** | Config file expected at `/app/config.yaml`, volume mounted elsewhere | `logs --previous`: `no such file or directory` | Fix `volumeMounts.mountPath` / ConfigMap key |
| 10 | **Port already in use** | Two containers in the same pod both use port 80 | `logs --previous`: `address already in use` | Use different ports |
| 11 | **Wrong image architecture** | ARM image on x86 node (or opposite) | `logs --previous`: `exec format error` | Build multi-arch image / correct tag |
| 12 | **Init container keeps failing** | Init container can't finish its task | `get pods`: `Init:CrashLoopBackOff` | `kubectl logs <pod> -c <init-container>` and fix it |
| 13 | **Liveness / startup probe failing** | Wrong path, port, command, short delay | `describe pod` Events: `Liveness probe failed` | See tests above |

### Exit codes (from `kubectl describe pod` → `Last State: Terminated`)

```
Last State:     Terminated
  Reason:       OOMKilled      ← why it stopped
  Exit Code:    137            ← number tells the reason
```

| Exit Code | Meaning | Usual cause |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | Finished normally | Container has no long-running process (reason 7) |
| `1` | App error | Missing env var, config error, code exception (reasons 1–4) |
| `126` | Command can't run | Permission denied (reason 8) |
| `127` | Command not found | Wrong `command:` (reason 6) |
| `137` | Killed (SIGKILL) | **OOMKilled** (reason 5) or killed after failed liveness probe |
| `139` | Segmentation fault | App crash in native code |
| `143` | Terminated (SIGTERM) | Stopped gracefully by K8s (e.g. liveness restart) |

### Example: missing environment variable

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: env-demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: busybox
    command: ["sh", "-c", "if [ -z \"$DB_HOST\" ]; then echo 'ERROR: DB_HOST not set'; exit 1; fi; sleep 3600"]
    # ❌ no env: → app exits with code 1 → CrashLoopBackOff
```

```bash
kubectl get pods                 # env-demo  0/1  CrashLoopBackOff  3
kubectl logs env-demo --previous # ERROR: DB_HOST not set
```

**Fix:** add the variable and re-create the pod:

```yaml
    env:
    - name: DB_HOST
      value: "mysql"
```

### Not CrashLoopBackOff (similar-looking errors)

| Status | Meaning | Not the same because |
|---|---|---|
| `ImagePullBackOff` / `ErrImagePull` | Can't download the image (wrong name/tag, private registry, no login) | Container **never started** |
| `CreateContainerConfigError` | Referenced **ConfigMap / Secret doesn't exist** (or key missing) | Container **never started** |
| `Pending` | No node has enough CPU/memory, or nodeSelector doesn't match | Pod **not scheduled** yet |
| `0/1 Running` | Readiness probe failing | Container **running**, no restart |

> Missing **env var the app needs** → app starts and exits → **CrashLoopBackOff**. Env from a **ConfigMap/Secret that doesn't exist** → container never starts → **CreateContainerConfigError**.

### Golden rule for CrashLoopBackOff

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod>           # Events + Last State (Reason, Exit Code)
kubectl logs <pod> --previous        # what the app printed BEFORE it crashed
kubectl logs <pod> -c <container>    # multi-container / init container
```

> **Interview one-liner:** CrashLoopBackOff means the container keeps crashing and K8s keeps restarting it with a growing delay. Common causes are missing env vars or config, an unreachable dependency, app errors, OOMKilled (exit 137), a wrong command (exit 127), a container with nothing long-running (exit 0), permission issues and failing liveness probes. I check `kubectl describe pod` for the reason and exit code, then `kubectl logs --previous` for the app error.

## 11. Falco: Kubernetes runtime security

**Definition:** **Falco** is an open-source (CNCF) **runtime security and threat detection** tool for Kubernetes. It **monitors all containers and nodes in real time** and **sends alerts** when something suspicious or malicious happens.

> ⭐ **Falco provides real-time visibility and alerts to keep your Kubernetes workloads safe.**

![Falco](images/falco.png)

**Why do we need it?** Probes check if the app is **healthy**. Nobody checks if someone is **attacking** it. Image scanning (Trivy) checks images **before** they run. Falco watches **while they run** ("runtime").

| Tool | Checks | When |
|---|---|---|
| Probes | Is the app healthy / ready? | While running |
| Trivy (image scan) | Known vulnerabilities in the image | **Before** running (build / CI) |
| **Falco** | **Suspicious activity / threats** | **While running** (runtime) |

### What Falco does (7 points from class)

| # | Feature | Simple meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Monitors containers & nodes in real time** | Watches every container and every worker node, all the time |
| 2 | **Detects threats while apps are running** | Finds attacks at runtime, not only at build time |
| 3 | **Watches system calls & Kubernetes events** | Sees every action: open file, run program, network connection, `kubectl` actions |
| 4 | **Generates alerts for quick incident response** | Sends an alert right away so the team can act |
| 5 | **Detects suspicious activities** | Shell access, privilege escalation, file changes, network risks |
| 6 | **Uses predefined & custom rules** | Ready-made rules + write your own to enforce policies |
| 7 | **Easy integration** | Works with K8s and sends alerts to Slack, email, SIEM, Prometheus, etc. |

### What it detects (examples)

| Suspicious activity | Example |
|---|---|
| **Shell access** | Someone runs `kubectl exec -it <pod> -- bash` into a production container |
| **Privilege escalation** | Process tries to become root / run privileged container |
| **File changes** | Writes to `/etc`, `/bin`, reads `/etc/shadow` (passwords) |
| **Network risks** | Container connects to an unknown IP / opens unexpected port (e.g. crypto miner) |
| **Unexpected programs** | Package manager (`apt`, `yum`) or `nc` run inside a running container |

### How it works, step by step

1. Falco runs as a **DaemonSet** → **one Falco pod on every worker node** (it must see every container on every node).
2. On each node, it reads **system calls** (what every process does) using an **eBPF** driver in the Linux kernel, plus **Kubernetes events**.
3. It compares each event with its **rules** (e.g. "shell started in a container").
4. A rule matches → Falco **generates an alert** (who, which pod, which command, when).
5. The alert goes to **logs** or, through **Falcosidekick**, to **Slack / email / SIEM** → team responds.

```
 Containers on node ──► system calls ──► Falco pod (DaemonSet, on every node)
                                              │  compare with rules
                                              ▼
                                       Rule matched? ──► ALERT 🚨 ──► logs / Slack / email
```

> Falco **detects and alerts**. It does **not block** the action by itself. Blocking is done by other tools (e.g. admission policies, Kyverno/OPA).

### Install Falco with Helm (from Artifact Hub, Helm use case 2)

All commands on the **🖥️ bastion** (or Killercoda control plane):

```bash
# 1. Add the official Falco chart repo (Verified Publisher: falcosecurity)
helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts
helm repo update

# 2. Install Falco in its own namespace
helm install falco falcosecurity/falco -n falco --create-namespace

# 3. Check: one Falco pod per worker node (DaemonSet)
kubectl get pods -n falco -o wide
kubectl get daemonset -n falco
```

### Test: trigger an alert

```bash
# 1. Start a test pod
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx

# 2. Do something suspicious: open a shell inside the container
kubectl exec -it nginx -- bash
exit

# 3. Read Falco's alerts
kubectl logs -n falco -l app.kubernetes.io/name=falco -c falco | grep -i shell
```

Example alert:

```
Notice A shell was spawned in a container with an attached terminal
  (user=root ... container_name=nginx ... k8s.pod=nginx shell=bash ...)
```

Falco saw `bash` start inside the `nginx` container → matched the built-in rule **"Terminal shell in container"** → alert 🚨.

**Clean up:**

```bash
kubectl delete pod nginx
helm uninstall falco -n falco
```

> **Interview one-liner:** Falco is a CNCF runtime security tool. It runs as a DaemonSet on every node, watches system calls and Kubernetes events with eBPF, matches them against rules, and sends real-time alerts for threats like shell access in a container, privilege escalation, sensitive file changes or unexpected network connections.

## 13. Interview Questions

### ⭐ Very Important

**Q1. What is a liveness probe?**
It checks if the application is alive at an interval we set. If it gets no response, Kubernetes restarts the container; if it gets a response, the container keeps running. Liveness probe = self-healing for your application.

**Q2. What happens when a liveness probe fails?**
After `failureThreshold` failures in a row, the kubelet restarts the container. The pod's `RESTARTS` count goes up.

**Q3. What are the 3 ways to check if your app is alive (probe types)?**
HTTP checks a web endpoint like `/health` (200–399 = healthy). TCP checks whether a port is accepting connections. EXEC runs a command inside the container and checks the result (exit 0 = healthy). HTTP = endpoint, TCP = port, EXEC = command.

**Q4. Explain the `liveness-http` probe: path `/`, port 80, initialDelaySeconds 15.**
Every 10 s the kubelet sends `GET http://<pod-ip>:80/` to nginx (nginx listens on 80). A 200–399 answer means healthy. The first check waits 15 s so nginx can start. If it fails 3 times in a row (no answer within 2 s, or an error like 404), the container is restarted. The path can be any endpoint the app serves (`/`, `/dev`, `/health`).

**Q5. What happens if the liveness probe never gets a response?**
After `failureThreshold` failures in a row the container is restarted. If it keeps failing after every restart, Kubernetes waits longer between restarts (10s, 20s, 40s ... up to 5 min) and the pod shows **CrashLoopBackOff**. Check `kubectl describe pod` events and `kubectl logs --previous`, then fix the path, port or initial delay.

**Q6. A pod is in CrashLoopBackOff. What is your first step and what can cause it with liveness probes?**
First `kubectl describe pod <pod>` and read the Events (`Liveness probe failed: ...`). Common causes: wrong path in httpGet (404), wrong port in httpGet/tcpSocket (connection refused), wrong command in exec (e.g. file not found), or too short `initialDelaySeconds`. Then check `kubectl logs --previous`, fix the YAML and re-create the pod.

**Q7. What is a readiness probe?**
It checks whether a pod is ready to receive user traffic. If the check fails, Kubernetes removes the pod from the Service endpoint list. The pod keeps running but does not receive traffic until it becomes ready. Used when apps need time to load data, cache or dependencies.

**Q8. If a readiness probe fails, is the pod restarted?**
No. It shows `READY 0/1` and `Running`, is removed from the Service endpoints, and gets traffic back when the check passes again. Only a liveness failure restarts the container.

**Q9. Do readiness probes use different check methods from liveness?**
No. Both use the same 3 methods: HTTP (endpoint), TCP (port), EXEC (command). Only the key name changes (`livenessProbe:` / `readinessProbe:` / `startupProbe:`) and the action on failure (restart vs no traffic).

**Q10. What is a startup probe?**
The very first probe. It checks whether the application has finished starting. Used for slow-starting apps so Kubernetes doesn't restart them while booting. Once it succeeds it stops, and liveness and readiness take over. If it keeps failing, the container is restarted.

**Q11. What is the order of the 3 probes?**
Startup first. Liveness and readiness are paused until startup succeeds, then both run for the life of the container.

**Q12. Where is a startup probe used in real time?**
For large Java, Spring Boot or database-based apps with long startup times. It avoids unnecessary restarts and CrashLoopBackOff by giving the app time to boot (max time = `failureThreshold` × `periodSeconds`) before liveness starts.

**Q13. Difference between startup, liveness and readiness probes?**
Startup: has the app finished starting? Runs first, once; failure → restart. Liveness: is the app alive? Runs all the time; failure → restart (self-healing). Readiness: is it ready for traffic? Runs all the time; failure → removed from Service endpoints, no restart (traffic control).

**Q14. How do you identify which probe is failing from `kubectl get pods`?**
`1/1 Running` = all good. `0/1` with RESTARTS going up / CrashLoopBackOff = liveness or startup failing. `0/1 Running` with RESTARTS not changing = readiness failing (no restart, no traffic). Confirm with `kubectl describe pod`: Events say `Liveness`, `Startup` or `Readiness probe failed`.

**Q15. What is Falco?**
A Kubernetes runtime security and threat detection tool. It monitors all containers and nodes in real time, watches system calls and Kubernetes events, and sends alerts for suspicious or malicious activity (shell access, privilege escalation, file changes, network risks). Falco provides real-time visibility and alerts to keep Kubernetes workloads safe.

**Q16. How does Falco work?**
It runs as a DaemonSet (one pod per node), reads system calls with an eBPF driver, compares them with predefined and custom rules, and generates an alert when a rule matches. Alerts go to logs or to Slack/email/SIEM through Falcosidekick.

**Q17. Difference between Trivy and Falco?**
Trivy scans images for known vulnerabilities before they run (build/CI). Falco detects threats while containers are running (runtime). Falco alerts; it does not block.

**Q18. Other than probes, what causes CrashLoopBackOff?**
Missing environment variable or wrong config, dependency (DB) not reachable, app code error, OOMKilled (exit 137), wrong command (exit 127), container with no long-running process (exit 0), permission denied, missing file/volume, port already in use, wrong image architecture, failing init container. Check `kubectl describe pod` (Reason, Exit Code) and `kubectl logs --previous`.

**Q19. Difference between CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff and CreateContainerConfigError?**
CrashLoopBackOff: container starts and keeps crashing. ImagePullBackOff: image can't be downloaded, container never starts. CreateContainerConfigError: referenced ConfigMap/Secret is missing, container never starts.

### Other Questions

**Q20. Why do we need a liveness probe if Kubernetes already restarts crashed containers?**
A crash stops the process, which K8s sees. A stuck app (deadlock, hang) keeps the process alive, so only a liveness probe can detect it.

**Q21. What can go wrong with a badly set liveness probe?**
If `initialDelaySeconds` is too short or the timeout too small, a healthy but slow app gets restarted again and again (restart loop / CrashLoopBackOff).

**Q22. For a slow-starting app, why use a startup probe instead of a long `initialDelaySeconds` on liveness?**
A long delay is a fixed guess and makes liveness slow for the whole life of the pod. A startup probe allows a long start time only once (`failureThreshold × periodSeconds`), stops as soon as the app is up, and then liveness keeps fast checks to catch hangs quickly.
